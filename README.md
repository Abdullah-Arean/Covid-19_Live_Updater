 A Python Program to display live update of Covid-19 status from government provided latest data. You can get full data of Bangladesh or districtwise. The speciality of this python program is flexibility in district name input.
 
 The Program will automatically guess right 'district name' for misspelled and wrong input in term of district name. Suppose you gave 'guzi' it will show data of 'Gazipur', you gave 'daka' or 'dhak' it will show data of 'Dhaka'.
